# Niter

A fast, statically-typed, programming language with a simple compiler built on LLVM.

```
using std:Console

fun main() {
    Console:println("Hello, World")
    return 0
}
```

Niter philosophy:

- Explicit is better than implicit
- Readability counts
- Purity and immuntability make for predictability
- Simplicity is better than complexity
- Versatility is better than simplicity
- Consistency is golden
- Manual memory management is always an option
